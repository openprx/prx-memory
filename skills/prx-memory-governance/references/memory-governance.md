# Memory Governance Reference

## Allowed storage
Store only reusable engineering knowledge:
- recurring failures
- architecture decisions
- reproducible debugging lessons

## Forbidden storage
- raw conversation summaries
- huge logs or stack traces
- one-off typos/misclicks
- noisy greetings/meta prompts

## Ratio and hygiene
- decision <= 30%
- keep entries atomic and searchable
- include stable prefixed tags for retrieval: `project:*`, `tool:*`, `domain:*`

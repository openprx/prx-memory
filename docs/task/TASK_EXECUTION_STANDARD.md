# prx-memory Task Execution Standard

## Usage Requirements
- For medium/large work items, create or update a task file under `docs/task/`.
- Task files must keep exactly three top-level sections: `Plan`, `Pending`, `Completed`.
- After each execution batch, update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Plan
- Goal:
- Scope:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Risks and rollback:

## Pending
- [ ] Task 1:
- [ ] Task 2:
- [ ] Task 3:

## Completed
- [x] YYYY-MM-DD Task A (result/evidence)
- [x] YYYY-MM-DD Task B (result/evidence)

## Maintenance Rules
- Keep only unfinished items under `Pending`.
- Move completed items to `Completed` with date and evidence.
- For testing/performance changes, record commands and key outcomes.
